# Interview Scheduler

## Description

Interview Scheduler is a single-page React application designed to streamline the process of scheduling appointments between students and interviewers. The app utilizes React's built-in hooks and custom hooks to add, edit, and delete appointments in real-time, providing an intuitive user experience. Most importantly, this project prioritizes test-driven development by using tools like Storybook, Jest, and Cypress to ensure that the app is thoroughly tested and reliable.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api) and follow the README to install and setup the API server/database
3. Start the Interview Scheduler in the root folder using `npm start`
4. Start the cloned Scheduler API in its root folder using `npm start`

** Note at its current state, Interviewer Scheduler MUST have the scheduler and api to run concurrently to be fully operational.
